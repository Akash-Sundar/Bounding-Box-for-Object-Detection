# Bounding-Box-for-Object-Detection
Bounding Boxes were used to locate and identify objects in an Image. Here is an example of detecting bounding boxes for Zombies using pretrained weights from MobileNetv2 and RetinaNet. The repository also consists of implementations for YOLO and FasterRCNN, popular bounding box detection algorithms that have been trained and inferenced.
